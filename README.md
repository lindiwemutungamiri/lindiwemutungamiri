## Projects

1. Building A CryptoCurrency Wallet Published Paper: [Thelpis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kKW6fKngCCOTCNYUm24Vk9r4iWDJiWc4/view?usp=sharing)

I am interested in deconstructing economic principles and finding innovative ways to build tech centered solutions in applying those principles. What is the future of finance? This question was addressed through the focus on cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance. The purpose of this applied capstone project was to demonstrate the capabilities of cryptocurrencies and the potential to alleviate poverty in Africa through financial inclusion using cryptocurrencies. This project drew on interviews, observations, and conversations with users who were already in the crypto space and those who aspired to be. It also drew on personal experiences with existing wallets and the challenges faced in those spaces. The result was a secure non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet named Thelpis that allows users to send, receive, and store cryptocurrencies.

2. Co-Founder: [LITH Africa](https://www.lithafrica.com/)

I am also keenly interested in Machine Learning, and I have employed it in my project LITH Africa. At LITH, we have built a mental health app that provides a centralized platform therapists to deliver Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to college students and use Machine Learning powered insights to monitor and track progress from their student clients. After taking a course in Artificial Intelligence, I did research on the use of wearables in improving the mental well-being of people in general.

Currently at LITH Africa, we are also incorporating Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision into our research to see how this technology can be used to revolutionize wellness in both developing and developed nations. With all this research and technology that we are building, we want to also reinforce the importance of developing ethical algorithms. This is an area that we explore, and we are keen on how we practice this ethical component while at the same time not drawing them into something that can be an addictive type of alternative to solutions that exist. I think this is an important discussion to have in ensuring that we remain ethical in developing these AI solutions.
