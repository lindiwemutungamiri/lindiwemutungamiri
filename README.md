## Lindiwe Mutungamiri Bio

I'm driven by a deep desire to build multinational companies that will change the world one day. I describe myself as a creative disruptor and an innovative entrepreneur on a mission to create new and effective systems in the world. I am a blockchain technology enthusiast with a keen interest in token engineering and designing new economic systems for a more equitable world. I am the founder of Thelpis which is a start-up using the principles of token engineering to create a new token economic system to promote financial inclusion for marginalized communities. Thelpis was shortlisted for the Tony Blair Institute Progress Fellows 2022 Cohort but narrowly missed on the final selection. The start-up was then selected for the Quest Fellowship Program  on Innovation & Entrepreneurship, Cohort 1 2022 where we receive business support. 

I also have a special interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and my interests have been reflected in the start-ups that I have built. I am the co-founder of the tech platform LITH Africa (leveraging intuitive technology for health) which integrates CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) and machine learning to support the mental well-being of African college students. LITH was a Fast Company 2021 World-Changing Ideas Honoree. The startup was also selected from a competitive pool for the one-year Ashesi Venture Incubator program where we receive business support and funding.

I graduated from Ashesi University in May 2022 with a BSc in Computer Science where I won several awards including the Ubora Rising Star Award and the Ustun Volleyball MVP Award. I have worked as a Business Strategy Analyst Intern with Stanbic Investment Management Services and worked as a Research Analyst Intern with the Baobab Platform under the MasterCard Foundation. I am a  Senior Fellow of the Melton Foundation Fellow and former Ashesi Junior Lead Melton Fellow as well. I have also served as a Junior Board of Directors Member of the 30-years-old Melton Foundation. At Ashesi University, I served 2 years under the Ashesi Student Council in the Judicial and Electoral Committee as a class representative.

When I am not trying to find innovative ways to solve problems, I can be found playing Volleyball, studying philosophy, studying economics, reading a good book, or travelling to new places.

## Papers and Projects

### 1. Paper + Project: [Thelpis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kKW6fKngCCOTCNYUm24Vk9r4iWDJiWc4/view?usp=sharing)

I am interested in deconstructing economic principles and finding innovative ways to build tech centered solutions in applying those principles. What is the future of finance? This question was addressed through the focus on cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance. The purpose of this applied capstone project was to demonstrate the capabilities of cryptocurrencies and the potential to alleviate poverty in Africa through financial inclusion using cryptocurrencies. This project drew on interviews, observations, and conversations with users who were already in the crypto space and those who aspired to be. It also drew on personal experiences with existing wallets and the challenges faced in those spaces. The result was a secure non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet named Thelpis that allows users to send, receive, and store cryptocurrencies.The project has now expanded to now educating other people on blockchain technology and building a team to improve and build on the app.

### 2. Co-Founder: [LITH Africa](https://www.lithafrica.com/)

I am also keenly interested in Machine Learning, and I have employed it in my project LITH Africa. At LITH, we have built a mental health app that provides a centralized platform therapists to deliver Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to college students and use Machine Learning powered insights to monitor and track progress from their student clients. After taking a course in Artificial Intelligence, I did research on the use of wearables in improving the mental well-being of people in general.

Currently at LITH Africa, we are also incorporating Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision into our research to see how this technology can be used to revolutionize wellness in both developing and developed nations. With all this research and technology that we are building, we want to also reinforce the importance of developing ethical algorithms. This is an area that we explore, and we are keen on how we practice this ethical component while at the same time not drawing them into something that can be an addictive type of alternative to solutions that exist. I think this is an important discussion to have in ensuring that we remain ethical in developing these AI solutions.
